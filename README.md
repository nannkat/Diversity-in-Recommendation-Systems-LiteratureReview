# EC601 Project 1 - Diversity in Recommender Systems 
## By Nanna Hannesdóttir
Exploration and literature review of the diversification of recommendation system algorithms. How could one design a recommendation system that generates more diversified recommendations than current ones? 

## Problem Statement
In the modern world we are surrounded by recommendation systems of various kinds. Whether it's on online shopping sites like Amazon, entertainment streaming sites like Netflix or Youtube, social media sites like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, the user is presented with filtered and curated content that is selected for them by recommendation algorithms. The most common drive behind the develeopement and research of these systems is to improve accuracy of the recommendations generated in order to recieve user satisfaction [[1]](#1). In recent times however, questions have started to emerge regarding the merit of this metric. Social and political events like the Trump Campaign of 2016 and the very recent spread of vaccine conspiracy theories via social media have sparked widespread discussions on the dark sides of so called "echo chambers" created by users recommendation feeds [[2]](#2)[[3]](#3). These red flags have not gone unnoticed. Media giants like Instagram and Google themselves have openly started acknowledging the problem and taking measures to address it through blog posts and research [[4]](#4)[[5]](#5). In fact, in their paper "Degenerate feedback loops in recommender systems", the researhcers at Google's DeepMind find that degenerate feedback loops are intrinsic features of current recommendation systems [[5]](#5). But how should we 

## Who would benefit from diversification and how? 
It goes without saying that the ubiquity of recommendation systems makes them a big influencer on the lives of most people in the modern world. As noted in the above paragraph blslandskfjn
